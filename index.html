    <p>Hi, I am a problem solver who loves to utilize technology and collaboration to tackle complex challenges. I've been working professionally as a Software Engineer for over 5 years, gaining tons of experience maintaining enterprise systems. I have been coding for web applications in JavaScript, TypeScript and Java on agile teams. I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2019 with my bachelors in Software Engineering and a minor in Computing Security. Evolving user experiences to center accessibility is one of my favorite parts of my career. In my free time I enjoy reading, petting my cat and painting.  </p>
