      <div class="content-box">
        <p>Hi I'm Mel, a professional problem solver who loves to utilize technology and collaboration 
          to tackle complex challenges. I've been working in the industry as a Software Engineer for 6 years, gaining tons of experience maintaining enterprise systems and building software from the ground up.
          My greatest achievements have been coding for web applications in JavaScript, TypeScript and Java on agile teams. I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2019 with my bachelors in Software Engineering and a minor in Computing Security. Evolving user experiences to center accessibility is one of my favorite parts of my career. In my free time I enjoy reading, petting my cat and painting.  </p>

        <h4>Muna Nation</h4>
        <span>Inspired by my love for the queer band MUNA, I created this React app as a space to archive all things MUNA. 
          Based on the Remix Netlify template to simplify the deployment process, which allowed me to set up the pipelines quickly.
          This sweet system uses Tailwind CSS to make the UX as styling as MUNA themselves.</span>
